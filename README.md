This project is intended as my personal project for genetic programming with individuals having a tree repersentation, whcih could be used for further applications such as symbolic regression. 

#### Some Acknowlegement and source material 
I had been reading the book "A Field Guide to Genetic Programming by Nicholas Freitag McPhee, Riccardo Poli, William B. Langdon" and wanted to apply some of the concepts and come up with a code. I have tried to use the naming notations for some of the programs amd have used some of the alogrithems mentioned in the book. So do check out the book for more information.


Project folder Structure: 
- utils
    - __init__.py
    - gp_function.py
    - gp_node.py 
    - gp_tree.py

File DEscription: 

1. gp_function.py : contains a function class GPFunction which will be used for creating the functions. 
2. gp_node.py : contains a node class GPNode which is the building block for a tree and can be used for both a terminal and a function node for a tree. 
3. gp_tree.py : contains a tree class GPTree which will act as the individuals for genetic algorithem programs.
